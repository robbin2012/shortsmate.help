# Supported Models

ShortsMate integrates multiple models that focus on script, visual, and video stages.

| Model type | Purpose | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Script/content models | Generate topics, outlines, hooks, and storyboard drafts | OpenAI GPT, Gemini, Qwen |
| Image/keyframe models | Generate key scenes, characters, and style-consistent stills | OpenAI GPT Image, Nano Banana |
| Video models | Generate clips, animations, and stabilizations | Veo (Fast/Quality tiers), Sora, Kling, Hailuo, MiniMax, Seedance, Jimeng, Grok |

You can switch between models with one click. Each model tier has its own price, and lower-resolution or lower-tier models usually cost less. Try the cheaper models first to validate your direction, and upgrade to higher-tier models when you need better quality.

## Choosing a model

- Define the goal (speed, polish, narrative) before pairing content/visual/video models
- Balance model tier (Fast vs. Quality) and resolution to control cost
- Start with defaults to validate direction, then upgrade to higher-tier models

## Model updates

Models and capabilities are continuously updated; refer to the product for the latest list.
