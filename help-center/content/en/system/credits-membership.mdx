## Credits vs subscription

- Credits cover scripts, storyboards, video, etc.; choose model/resolution/duration based on the task  
- Subscriptions bump limits, add parallel slots, VIP queueing, and commercial rights  
- Pay-as-you-go credits remain an option for occasional users

## Balance & upgrades

- Check remaining credits/history in the billing section  
- Try Starter first to validate direction, then upgrade to Creator/Pro as needed  
- For invoices, enterprise plans, or bulk discounts, mention it in your support ticket
